# Minium, Lithium Sinatrafied

## What It Is?
It's for you all minimalist lover but want powerful tools. 
Lithium is an awesome and powerful framework. But sometimes you only need routing without
all wacky wacky MVC. Minium is an example of how to do it.

## How To Use It?
Clone this repository and save it in your lithium folders so your folders now consist of
`app`, `libraries`, and `minium`. Change the contents of `routes.php` and `filters.php` to
your needs. Access it via `http://your_domain/path/to/lithium/minium`.
